Grasp - Groovy Application Split
================================

*The project has less that alpha status and is only for experimental use!*

Purpose
-------
Grasp is targeted at implementing an application split for 
event driven user interface technologies.
Java Swing is the first example, but it is destined to become independent of the 
widget set.

The proposed application split encompasses patterns and 
other lessons learnt from at least three considerably big
GUI-heavy applications.

Two cornerstones are the Presentation Model Pattern and 
declarative binding. Both require a dynamic language for a
generic implementation and we have chosen Groovy for that
purpose.
